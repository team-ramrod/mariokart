/// !Purpose
/// 
/// Methods and definitions for configuring interrupts using the Nested
/// Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).
/// 
/// !Usage
///
/// -# Configure interrupt source by implementing specific functions and define
///    ...
/// -# Configure the interrupt settings using NVIC_ConfigureIT
/// -# Enable or disable interrupt generation of a particular source with
///    NVIC_EnableIT and NVIC_DisableIT.
///
/// \note Most of the time, peripheral interrupts must be also configured
/// inside the peripheral itself.
