/// \page "RawNandflash"
///
/// !!!Purpose
/// 
/// RawNandflash is a bl Nandflash driver, it directly interacts with hardware's register to 
/// operate Nandflash interface, and it is called by upper layer drivers, such as EccNandFlash
///  
/// !!!Usage
///
/// -# RawNandFlash_Initialize is used to initializes a RawNandFlash instance based on the given
///      model and physical interface. If no model is provided, then the function tries to autodetect
///      it.
/// -# RawNandFlash_Reset is used to reset a Nandflash device.
/// -# RawNandFlash_ReadId is used to read a Nandflash's id.
/// -# RawNandFlash_EraseBlock is used to erase a certain Nandflash device's block.
/// -# RawNandFlash_ReadPage and RawNandFlash_WritePage is used to do read/write operation.
/// -# RawNandFlash_CopyPage is used to issue copypage command to Nandflash device.
/// -# RawNandFlash_CopyBlock calls RawNandFlash_CopyPage to do a Nandflash block copy.
