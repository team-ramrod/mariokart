Intro slide:
Safety by design - Designing a distributed system to mitigate and eliminate risk.

Overview:
Many sources of risk in a project like this one.
Inherited problems - Not our concern
Hardware problems - easy to test for.
Software problems - Easy to test for the bugs that present themselves often. Errors that take some time or certain conditions to manifest themselves are not likel;y to be discovered during testing.


The first set of problems we can discover and correct in the testing phase. For issues we cannot solve we can set guidelines to mitigate problems: Speed limiting, kill button, checking connections etc.

Modelling
What is a model.
What does a model not do: implementation, calculation
What's the point.

SPIN/Promela
SPIN, the Simple Promela INterpretor, is an tool used to simulate and verify the correctness of models written in the Promela language.
