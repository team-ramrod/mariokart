\section{Budget}
After building preliminary system designs, a bill of materials including parts
costs has been composed. Where possible pieces have been sourced from either Digikey,
Element 14, Mouser or estimated if the components will come from the ECE store.

Currently both the gear motor with encoder and the linear actuator have been
ordered as they have a month lead time coming from the USA. All other components
will be ordered within the next two weeks.

\section{Timeline}
The Autonomous Go-Kart project has been broken down into small sections then
time allocations have been put next to each task. Where possible we have put in
dependencies between each of the tasks. However this model of only starting one
task once the previous one has been completed is not very accurate. For example
the control software has been represented as requiring the hardware to be
complete. Actually the control software will be started much before the hardware
is complete.

To make sure the project deadlines are met, milestones have been added for each
assessment or deliverable. This puts the whole year in perspective, including
where we are currently with handing in the specification report. There will also
be weekly milestones added that will be set and evaluated each meeting. These
weekly milestones are to ensure we keep on track with the scheduled timeline.

Currently the timeline of the project extends past the inspection milestone.
After working out how long each task would take we noticed that the sub project
tasks included in Sensing and Behavioural Control are very likely to push the
project time past the inspection deadline. This means that currently the chances
of achieving all of our goals are slim. However assuming we are able to stick to 
this plan, we expect to achieve our goal of Drive-by-Wire control within the given
time frame.
