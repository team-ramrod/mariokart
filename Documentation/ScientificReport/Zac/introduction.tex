\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project was to explore the possible methods of tracking a marker using computer vision. The objective was to implement the chosen system on an autonomous go-kart for use in following a leading person or vehicle that possessed this marker. The system had to interface with a laptop that was mounted on this go-kart, the system had to operate in real time recognizing the marker, finding its location and outputting the path to travel on with minimal lag. The system had to be able to work in the environment of a mobile go-kart that could travel at up to 50 KMPH and was powered by a large electric dc motor. The kart was expected to be able to operate in both indoor and outdoor environments in a large variety of conditions. \cite{yeah,lol}
