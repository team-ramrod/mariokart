\section{Marker Location Methods}

A large variety of location methods were looked at when determining what type of sensors should be purchased for the kart system. Most modern autonomous vehicles rely heavily on scanning laser sensors as their main method of viewing the surroundings. Scanning lasers rapidly move a measuring laser over the environment forming a matrix of distances to provide a 3d view of the world. While extremely useful these sensors were discounted early due to their high price tag with even the most basic models starting at \$2000. The Microsoft Kinect camera was briefly looked at as an alternative solution that would provide 3d information about the world. This camera used structured light combined with an ir camera to detect the loctaion of objects in its field of view. This was also quickly discounted however as it had a maximum range of only 3.5m which was too limiting for the application. A second aspect that counted against it was that the ir pattern used by the Kinect was also washed out by direct sunlight making outdoor use impractical.

GPS systems were discounted due to their inability to work reliably in an indoor environment. One solution that was given serious consideration was using a marker that output a RF signal and having three receivers on the kart use its signal strength to triangulate the position of the object. After further research it was found however that distance estimation using the level of RF detectors that were within our budget were only accurate to around 1m under ideal conditions \cite{rf}. This limitation means that the receivers must be placed far apart to minimize the effect the error would have on the direction the triangulation would calculate the signal to have come from. On a mobile kart system where the close proximity of the sensors was unavoidable this limitation made the method infeasible.

The sensor system that was decided upon to develop was a computer vision system. This system would utilize a web-cam mounted to the front of the kart. A unique marker was to be used that could be located in the image. This method had several advantages over the other methods considered. It was a cheap and easy to mount solution with only a web-cam required that would attach straight to the laptop with a USB cable leading to no foreseeable hardware problems. It also provided a large degree of flexibility with a large suite of different algorithms and methods able to be implemented and tested for no modifications to the system. It was the only system that showed promise in being able to locate a marker accurately at distance within the budget so it was the only system pursued for development.
