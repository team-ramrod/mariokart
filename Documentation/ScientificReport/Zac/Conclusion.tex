\section{Conclusion}

Three computer vision solutions were looked at for tracking a marker for use in allowing a kart to follow a lead vehicle. Colour detection was found to be too sensitive to changes in lighting conditions for it to be used in a robust tracking system. The SURF algorithm ran slowly and its inability to handle even small amounts of motion blur made it inappropriate for the application of being mounted to a moving vehicle. Chessboard detection was the only system that was robust enough to detect a marker and give its position reliability and it was slightly hindered by it own inability to deal with large amounts of motion blur. The output of these systems were combined with sensors measuring the speed and wheel angle of the kart to produce a system that followed the path the marker had taken rather than the marker giving more accurate following.
