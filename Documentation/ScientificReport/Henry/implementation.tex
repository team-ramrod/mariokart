\section{Implementation}
  This meant that it was going to be ideal associating electronic hardware with
  each component of the kart. This was especially important as to minimise the
  delay for PID control of the actuators meant that a higher baud rate was
  required. 

\subsection{Hardware}
  This lead us to taking on a model of a distributed hardware platform.
