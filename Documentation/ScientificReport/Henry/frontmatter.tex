\begin{abstract}
  This report details the design and production of a hardware platform to for
  an autonimous go-kart. The system includes seven printed circuit boards
  (PCBs).  Five of the PCBs communicate via a CAN bus to collect data and
  control other circuitry, while the other two PCBs control actuators for
  steering and brake control. The system is based around Atmel AT91SAM7XC micro
  controllers along with various other electronics. The PCBs built for this
  system  are four layers so were manufactured in America by Advanced Circuits,
  then populated and tested at the University of Canterbury.
