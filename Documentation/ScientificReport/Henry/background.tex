\section{Background}
  To interface to the go-kart, actuators were required to be placed at both the
  front of the kart, as well as interfacing to the power electronics in the
  rear.

\subsection{The Go-kart}
  The department has 5 electric go-karts that were purchased for the specific
  purpose of a assignment and project platform, one of these shown in Fig.
  \ref{go-kart}. Throughout the year several, mostly power electronics,
  assignments are based on the Junoir Sport JS80IIR go-kart\cite{go-kart}. These
  go-karts are 1.7 meters in length, can hold two passengers and came with a
  80cc petrol motor. The petrol motor has since been replaced with a DC electric
  motor and batteries.

  \end{figure}


\subsection{Power Supply}
  The go-kart has a single power source for the whole vehicle. Two lead-acid
  batteries provide power for the existing DC drive motor and power electronics.
  These batteries can handle large currents at a voltage ranging up to 26 volts.
  The batteries have also been made accessible to be used for the autonomous
  vehicle control system.

\subsection{Power Electronics}
  To control the DC Drive motor, the department has designed and built three
  PCBs to switch and regulate currents going through the motor. Figure
  \ref{powerE} shows the three PCBs, where from left to right they are known as
  the \emph{student board}, \emph{control safety board} and \emph{power
  electronics board}. The \emph{student board} is a 5V logic board that takes
  the position of the accelerator pedal, current sensor data and outputs a PWM
  signal for the \emph{control safety board}. The control safety board is there
  to make sure the \emph{power electronics board} is not incorrectly driven,
  which would damage the go-kart.

\subsection{Actuator Control}
  To control the steering position and apply the brakes two actuators were
  purchased for the project.

  \subsubsection{Steering}
    The steering motor is a 24V DC motor that has a step down gear box with an
    output ratio of 393:1. On the top end of the motor, there is a magnetic
    encoder\cite{encoder} that outputs 18 pulses per motor revolution. This is that it outputs
    7,074 pulses per 360 degrees of rotation on the steering wheel. At peak
    load, the steering motor can draw up to 10Amps continuously.

  \subsubsection{Brake}
    To control the position of the brake a linear actuator is used. The linear
    actuator has an extension of 101.6mm and can travel at 20mm/s. It provides
    absolute position feedback via a $10k\ohm$ potentiometer. As with the
    steering motor, the brake linear actuator ran at 24V but only draws a peak
    current of 1.3Amps.

\subsection{Communication With A Laptop}
  Because most laptops have dropped all serial RS-232 ports, the only reliable
  option for serial communications is to use USB.

\subsection{Schematic \& PCB design tools}
  To generate the PCBs and schematics, Altium Designer was used\cite{altium}.
  Altium Designer is a complex electronics design package that can be used from
  a variety of tasks. However in this project only the schematic layout and PCB
  design tools were used.
