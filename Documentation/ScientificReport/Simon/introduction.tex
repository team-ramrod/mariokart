    The system on which this report will base most of the examples was codenamed
    Mariokart.  This was a final year project for the University of Canterbury's
    Bachelor of Engineering degree carried out by the authors.  The overall goal
    of the project was to take one of the electric go-karts the department had
    and retrofit a drive-by-wire system on to it with an overall goal of having
    the kart autonomously drive around the campus.  For the purposes of this
    report the main details of the system developed are:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item 
        The overall design is a distributed system, 5 boards are used; one for
        communication with a host laptop, one for steering, one for brakes, one
        to interface to the motor controller and one for collecting data from a
        variety of sensors.

      \item
        Each board is running an Atmel SAM7XC microprocessor.

    Vehicle} by Henry Jenkins \cite{jenkins_2011}.
