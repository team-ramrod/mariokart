\section{Safety - A Method}
Describe how we are going to take a divide and conquer approach to categorising 
sources of risk to ensure that all issues are considered, even if some things are not
considered in a lot of detail.
\subsection{Pitfalls in Risk Management}
relying on qualitative judgement

Checking after vs integrated into design

\subsection{Preventing Mistakes}

\subsection{Risk Analysis}
Risk, according to ISO 31000\cite{}, is the effect of uncertainty on objectives. 
Therefore, in order to minimise risk we need to minimise uncertainty.

\subsection{Mitigation}
Results of previous section

Global mitigations

Specific mitigations

Un-mitigated risk?

\subsection{Minimising Risk Through Modelling}
What modelling is in this context

SPIN, a short intro with references

The scope of a model - law of diminishing returns - Modelling needs to be a worthwhile investment

Modelling the temporal responses of the system - or not

\subsubsection{The Benefits of Modelling a Distributed System}
Promela model vs state diagrams and other sketched plans - or both

\subsection{Modelling Mariokart}
A focus on message passing and states.

Unexpected behaviour (errors and power loss) are explicitly specified instead of 
a fine-grained model in which these may arise naturally.

Explain the never claim. plus the automatically generated claims.
