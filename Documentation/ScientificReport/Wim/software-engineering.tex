  \subsection{Version Control}

    Out of all Software Engineering practices Version Control is definitely the
    most widely used by normal engineers.  Unfortunately it is still not used
    everywhere.  For example, you have just finished looking at a new power
    regulation system that you want to switch to for your next PCB revision; now
    you need to write a quick report on why it is so much better than the
    current system that you should spend all this time changing your design.
    What's the first thing you should do, open a new word document?  Load up
    your \LaTeX editor?  \emph{No}, you should initialise a new repository or ensure
    you have the projects documentation repository available and updated.
    Anything and everything that is more than a few lines long, or will ever be
    shared with a team member should be under version control.

    This is very important for a multitude of reasons.  Firstly it provides you
    with a time line of development activity
