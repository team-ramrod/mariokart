\subsection{Unit Testing}
  
  As mentioned earlier Unit Testing is currently seeing a major increase in use
  in forward-thinking software development companies, mainly because of
  evangelical Agile development proponents.  Unfortunately despite this increase
  for traditional software development, the uptake in embedded development
  projects has been a lot slower.

  The basic premise of unit testing is that if you validate that all parts of
  your system work as intended then the system as a whole will work as intended.
