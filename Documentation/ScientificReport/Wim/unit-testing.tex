\subsection{Unit Testing}
  
  As mentioned earlier Unit Testing is currently seeing a major increase in use
  in forward-thinking software development companies, mainly because of
  evangelical Agile development proponents.  Unfortunately despite this increase
  for traditional software development, the uptake in embedded development
  projects has been a lot slower.

  The basic premise of unit testing is that if you verify that all parts of your
  system work as intended, then the system as a whole will work as intended.  To
  do the verify you write a lot of small \emph{unit} tests to verify minimal
  sections of your code.  By ensuring that all code you write is tested by
  multiple unit tests you can be confident that the code performs as you expect.

  Of course this isn't the same thing as being right, unit tests only verify
  that the code does what the test says it should.  To ensure the code does what
  it should do you need to validate your tests.  This is most commonly done
  informally, the test developers know the intended outcome and the tests with
  the codes purpose in mind.  For more critical systems an external validation
  can be performed using a method such as modelling.  Our attempts at modelling
  one of the critical sections of our system can be read about in \emph{Safety
  by Design for the Mariokart System} by Simon Richards \cite{Richards_2011}.
